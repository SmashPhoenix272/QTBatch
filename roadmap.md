# QTBatch Project Roadmap

## Project Summary

QTBatch is a Python-based application that combines AI-powered proofreading and translation capabilities, with a focus on Chinese text processing. The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use and integrates various AI providers such as Google's Generative AI and Vertex AI. Key features include AI proofreading, quick translation, Chinese name recognition, and efficient text processing utilities.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

- [x] Set up version control (Git) and initialize repository
- [x] Create a virtual environment for the project
- [x] Set up project structure (directories for source code, tests, resources)
- [x] Create and configure `requirements.txt` for project dependencies
- [x] Implement logging configuration (`logging_config.py`)
- [x] Set up configuration management (`config.py`, `config.yaml`)
- [x] Create `.gitignore` file for version control

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Development

- [x] Implement AI proofreading core logic (`ai_proofread.py`)
- [x] Develop quick translation functionality (`QuickTranslator.py`)
- [x] Create Chinese name recognition system (`ChineseNameRecognition.py`)
- [x] Implement name analysis logic (`name_analyzer.py`)
- [x] Develop caching mechanism for proofreading results (`proofread_cache.py`)
- [x] Implement utility functions (`utils.py`)
- [x] Create character replacement functionality (`ReplaceChar.py`)
- [x] Develop chapter detection methods (`detect_chapters_methods.py`)

### Phase 3: GUI Development

- [x] Design and implement main application GUI (`gui.py`)
- [x] Create AI proofreading GUI component (`gui_ai_proofread.py`)
- [x] Develop dialog boxes for user interactions (`gui_dialogs.py`)
- [x] Implement GUI update mechanisms (`gui_updates.py`)
- [x] Create utility functions for GUI operations (`gui_utils.py`)
- [x] Design and implement settings GUI for name export (`export_names2_settings_gui.py`)
- [x] Integrate icons and fonts into the GUI

### Phase 4: AI Integration and Enhancement

- [x] Implement Google Generative AI SDK integration (`providers/google_generativeai_sdk.py`)
- [x] Develop Vertex AI SDK integration (`providers/vertex_ai_sdk.py`)
- [ ] Create a provider selection mechanism for multiple AI services
- [ ] Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms for AI services
- [ ] Optimize AI request batching and response handling
- [ ] Develop a system for managing API keys and quotas

### Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance

- [x] Set up testing framework and write initial tests
- [x] Implement unit tests for name analyzer (`tests/test_name_analyzer.py`)
- [x] Create unit tests for quick translator (`tests/test_quick_translator.py`)
- [ ] Develop integration tests for AI proofreading functionality
- [ ] Implement GUI tests to ensure proper functionality
- [ ] Perform thorough error handling and edge case testing
- [ ] Conduct performance testing and optimization

### Phase 6: Documentation and Deployment

- [x] Write comprehensive README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- [ ] Create user documentation for application features and usage
- [ ] Document API and core functions with docstrings
- [ ] Generate developer documentation for project architecture and components
- [ ] Create a change log to track version updates
- [ ] Prepare release notes for initial version
- [ ] Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
- [ ] Create installation and deployment scripts
- [ ] Prepare for initial release and distribution

## Conclusion

This roadmap outlines the development plan for the QTBatch project, breaking down the process into manageable phases and tasks. By following this plan, we aim to create a robust, user-friendly application that leverages AI for efficient text processing, proofreading, and translation. Regular reviews and updates to this roadmap will ensure that the project stays on track and adapts to any changing requirements or newly discovered needs.
